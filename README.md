Hybrid Topology – Cisco Packet Tracer
This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a Hybrid Topology in Cisco Packet Tracer, which combines features of multiple topology types (like star, mesh, and bus) to create a more flexible and reliable network structure.

📘 Project Overview
A Hybrid Topology leverages the strengths of different network topologies to achieve optimized performance, scalability, and fault tolerance. In this project, the network integrates star connections for simplicity, mesh connections for redundancy, and linear links for cost efficiency.

Key Advantages:

Combines benefits of multiple topologies

Higher scalability and flexibility

Better fault tolerance compared to pure star or bus setups

🖥️ Network Topology
Components Used:

Switches: 8 × Cisco 2960-24TT

⚙️ Configuration Steps
1️⃣ Connect Devices

Connect each PC to its respective switch using copper straight-through cables.

Connect switches according to the hybrid design (star + mesh + linear).

2️⃣ Assign IP Addresses

Configure each PC with its respective IP address and subnet mask (255.255.255.0).

3️⃣ Test Connectivity

Use the ping command between all PCs to ensure full communication.

🎯 Learning Objectives
Understand the concept of Hybrid Topology.

Learn how to integrate multiple topology types in one network.

Assign and manage IP addresses for end devices.

Test and verify connectivity in a mixed-topology environment.

🧠 Key Notes
Hybrid topology design depends on network requirements and budget.

Combining topologies improves fault tolerance but can increase complexity.

Best suited for large networks that need both performance and scalability.
